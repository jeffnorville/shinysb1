# Week 27, 2016
Welcome to week 18 of 25. Happy Independence Day, US!

```{r plot il reste, echo = FALSE}
thesis.duration <- 25
this.week <- 18
yikes <- c(this.week, thesis.duration - this.week) / thesis.duration
barplot(as.matrix(yikes), horiz=TRUE, beside=FALSE)
title(main = paste("I must be ", yikes[1]*100, "% done!"), font = 3)

```

## Big changes:

Upload App:

 * When uploading a second/replacement file, interface is "buggy" - file not replaced; status bar sticks; etc
    + SO question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17352086/how-can-i-update-a-shiny-fileinput-object/33271056#33271056
    + https://gist.github.com/davidarndt/bc09d77fa92457e094c8
 * Rdata file defined (2016/07/04) AND 
 * text file added (2016/07/06)
 * we still have to solve the problem of loading without overwriting conflicting variables by name...
 
```{r eval=FALSE}
#clever function which loads an RData file, and returns it
loadRData <- function(fileName){
    load(fileName)
    get(ls()[ls() != "fileName"])
}
d <- loadRData("~/Rhome/example.RData")
```

Viewer App got a new workflow last week:

* User begins by selecting Forecast Type between
    + Seasonal
    + Short Range, or
    + Medium Range

* then select a Forecast System:
    + ECMWF
    + GR4J
    + user-added...
    
* User may alternatively begin with a clickable map of Case Studies
    + 
    

* Am also considering a superuser-type tool to postgresql built in MS Access...
    + Irstea has MS Office Pro (for Windows users)
    + MS Access plays nicely with postgresql
    + can import / export data
    + should be able to RAD in August if not before
    + just found a way to avoid per-machine DSN setup
        + http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/24-Using-MS-Access-with-PostgreSQL.html
        
 

## Modified database schema:

Dates -- 7 july we discussed changing the date format type to "Julian dates". However, there seems to be a lot of disagreement to what exactly that means ...

http://www.cpearson.com/excel/jdates.htm

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/date/date.pdf
Convert to Julian Dates
Description
Given a month, day, and year, returns the number of days since January 1, 1960.
Usage
mdy.date(month, day, year, nineteen = TRUE, fillday = FALSE,
fillmonth = FALSE)




We discussed adding the following details to the database:
    + location coordinates
    + more information about the uploader

## To Read
I'm watching DataCamp's "writing functions in R" series, free so far, and useful!

I note I'm not using R's functions well at all. Also pipes -- reading Yonicd's code (link below) mystifies me. Time to level up.

Also, lists ... problematic. This helped: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2050790/how-to-correctly-use-lists-in-r

* to fix my fileInput dialogue:
    + https://gist.github.com/davidarndt/bc09d77fa92457e094c8
    
* popup windows ARE possible in Shiny ... sorta:
    + http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32226331/r-shiny-pop-up-window-with-options
* need some of the magic Yonicd uses in this elections Shiny app:
    + https://github.com/yonicd/Elections

* button export to PDF
    + http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27276994/outputting-shiny-non-ggplot-plot-to-pdf
    + https://gist.github.com/yihui/6091942
    
* little map demo
    + leaflet:
    + https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html
    +     
    
 

```{r plot plot from shiny}
library(dplyr)
library(lazyeval)
library(ggplot2)

play.data <- read.delim("~/R/shinysb1/docs/play.data.txt")
play.data$locationID <- as.factor(play.data$locationID)
plot(play.data$leadtimeValue, play.data$scoreValue, col=play.data$locationID, 
     xlab = "Lead Times", ylab = "Score")
     
# get fancier
pd <- position_dodge(0.2)
min.LT <- min(play.data$leadtimeValue)
max.LT <- max(play.data$leadtimeValue)

ggplot(play.data, aes(color = locationID, x = leadtimeValue, y = scoreValue )) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=scoreValue-ci, ymax=scoreValue+ci), position = pd) + # , color="grey"
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(color = locationID), position = pd) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0), color="blue", linetype="dashed") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(min.LT:max.LT)) +
  xlab("Lead Times") + ylab("Score")
     
```

 
 

We also simplified the wording on the display again; I need to follow this with database logic to be sure names are clear and sensible (self-documenting).

I'm also adding a layer of reactivity BEFORE the filter function; now we have a box filled by database which lists which packages are available:


# Images of current interface
![CRPS for 2 locs, 10 LTs](../figures/2016-06-17_2locsCRPS.png)

This week I need to: 

* prep slides for 10 minute "wave peaks" presentation
    + less technic, more "qualitative" study
    + underscore the utility in comparing score types
    + examples of other scoreboards...?
    
* Enhance data import definition 
    + example file
    + user preview (?) before database import run
    
* Change interface:
    + reduce "summary";
    + reduce emphasis on conf interval plot (ci and se agglom function, summarySE);
    + add ability to post 2eme Score Type to same page (or more?)
    
Planning:
* ggplot libraries
    + facet;
    + map (GDAL);
    



### Old Notes (for my reference):

Got access to a 2013 netCDF [development branch for SOS DB] (https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/main/SOS/Service/branches/52n-sos-netCDF/), so I'll look into that this week to understand better our options for accomodating netCDF files (a soft requirement which we won't implement without motivation!).

* Some helpful r debugging links:
    + http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/software/debuggingR/
    + http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/debugging.html

Keeps coming back up (particularly for multiple users in web app!) but not dealt with:
