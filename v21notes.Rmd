## Week 21, 2016
Welcome to week 12 of 34...

```{r plot il reste}
thesis.duration <- 34
this.week <- 12

# yikes <- c(this.week, thesis.duration - this.week) / thesis.duration
# barplot(as.matrix(yikes), horiz=TRUE, beside=FALSE)
# ggplot(yikes, aes(x = "time", y = thesis.duration))

```

Last week I got a couple new interactive plots working, and tweaked the slider to use a default lead time at first -- then allow the user to expand to all leadtimes. (Not every system has the same value of leadtimes however, so for comparisons this could get weird?)

![Brier 80 score for precipitation model, lead times 5 - 10](figures/20160523_brierScrPPT_LT5-10.png)

Note these Brier scores are raw, still not normalized ... wups.

TODO: for example a skill calculation root-mean squared error (RMSE):
$$ RMSE = {\sqrt {\frac{1} {N}{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {(c_{i} - \bar{c}_{i} } })^{2} } }   $$

Skill score (SS) associated with RMSE:
$$ SS = 1 - \frac{ RMSE _{forecast}}{RMSE _{observations}} $$

![CRPS for precipitation model, lead times 1 - 90](figures/20160523_crpsScrPPT_LT0-90.png)

Normalized plots in ggplot2 coming up soon! These are just placeholders while I get the database running/secure at AWS.

I've been adding notes to a LaTeX outline for the thesis document -- "memoire", en franÃ§ais. At this moment I've got multi-lingual abstracts, but am writing in English...


Think I'm getting the hang of using [github](https://github.com/jeffnorville/shinysb1/) to keep current between home and "office" ... but I should've used a pseudonym while I learn R. Ouch, ugliness.


Got access to a 2013 netCDF [development branch for SOS DB] (https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/main/SOS/Service/branches/52n-sos-netCDF/), so I'll look into that this week to understand better our options for accomodating netCDF files (a requirement which became more likely last week).


This week I need to: 
* finish loading our current "draft" data
    + ECMWF forecast model (EFAS) scores and observations
    + SMHI forecast model (EHYPE) scores and potentially observations

* deploy AWS instance of shiny server
    + http://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-rstudio-shiny-server-on-aws/
    + for when shinyapps.io stops hosting us
    + which'll solve the ".Rfiles" hosting problem (~~currently shiny deploy breaks these files~~)
    + update: according to [a note here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/shinyapps-users/dMjMJlk0cPQ/kB4GiIE7DQAJ) this is actually solvable using rsconnect:deployApp()... to be continued

* decide if the SOS database format is the way to go forward,
    + which makes maintenance easier
    + more durable
    + bit trickier upfront !
* mysteries to solve
    + ...
* R fundamentals I still need
    + ~~ggplot2~~
    + facet()
* Some helpful r debugging links:
    + http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/software/debuggingR/
    + http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/debugging.html

This week so far I am also reading and writing:

* Reading:
    + http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/session.html

* More Reading:
    + Colleagues published a paper on drought-resistant governance: 
    http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-29671-5_11/fulltext.html
    


We need a structure for the scores to import - currently receiving text files and 3D "cubes" depending on source... tidying takes time; should be automated so users may load / arrange their scores (like EVS).

Considering NetCDF for this ... oldie but goodie? Opinions?

Something to look into on my time -- confidence Intervals discussed in different context:
