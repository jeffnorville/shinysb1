## Week 19, 2016
Happily it's not week 19 of the internship, just 2016. However, it's already week 10 of 34!

```{r plot il reste}
thisweek <- 10
yikes <- c(thisweek, 34-thisweek) / 34
barplot(as.matrix(yikes), horiz=TRUE, beside=FALSE)
```

Last week I got all our current scores loaded into a local postgres database; poked through a shiny tutorial; switched from RPostgres driver to dplyr (for better or worse); and corrected a first CRPS plot to make a little sense.

It's true, sometimes this geologist struggles to grok the model scores in forecasting!

This week I need to:

* decide if the SOS database format is the way to go forward,
    + which makes maintenance easier
    + but dplyr less useful
    + and I'd learn curl
* load data to AWS instance
    + use .Renviron to point at dev / prod databases
* mysteries to solve
    + where does dplyr disconnect pooled connections?
    + strategies for a multi-user app?
* R fundamentals I still need
    + difference btw filter() and subset?
    + ggplot2
    + facet()
* Some helpful r debugging links:
    + http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/software/debuggingR/
    + http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/debugging.html
    + other ideas?


This week so far I have:

* modified local db to match v2 specifics
* built interactive dataframe to postgres db,
* built csv upload function which loads SMHI files successfully
* finished main score series viewer


This first-pass structure worked for simple data off all one datatype...

![ERD v0.1](C:\Users\jeffrey.norville\Documents\VerificationScorecard\ERDv001.png)

... but in fact we are scoring many variables which need to be tied together more explicitely. Hence, version 2:

![ERD v0.2](C:\Users\jeffrey.norville\Documents\VerificationScorecard\ERD_v2.png)



We need a structure for the scores to import - currently receiving text files and 3D "cubes" depending on source... tidying takes time; should be automated so users may load / arrange their scores (like EVS).

Something to look into on my time -- confidence Intervals discussed in different context:
